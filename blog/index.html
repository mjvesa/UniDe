<h1>Unide 0.2.0 and the road towards 1.0.0</h1>

<p>The version 0.2.0 of Unide marks a return to old goals in its development.
There was a brief moment where it was considered that Unide would produce plain
Java projects and nothing more, but from now on Unide will be universal again
and produce projects and views for many different frameworks.</p>

<h2>Changes in 0.2.0</h2>

<p>The esoteric nature of the internal model of Unide has been addressed
with the introduction of an XML editor.  It allows editing the model directly
in XML, a format that should be more familiar to designers. Performance and 
layout issues with the editor will be addressed in later versions.</p>

<p>Sketch Mode no longer replaces the entire design, but appends the sketched
design into the end of the existing one. This allows one to draw a small
piece of the view in SM and then move it to the correct place.</p>

<p>Setting the project format now takes place in the settings page.</p>

<h2>Plans for 0.3.0</h2>

<p>Unide is still very much taking its first steps and trying to find its place
in the world. One new place it might find itself in is the Visual Studio Code
editor. With upcoming additions such as generation of event listeners,
iteration and conditional rendering, it becomes pertinent to have proper
support for editing the code that lives beside the design. Having that
in Unide itself would introduce many complications, so it makes more sense to
embed into a well known text editing platform and use its features instead.</p>

<p>Having Unide as a VSCode extension does not mean that the standalone and web
versions would be gone, but rather that VSCode will be an additional platform
to use it on.</p>

<p>Vaadin 15 will support UI logic on the client side. An exporter for that
will be added and it will be kept up to date as Vaadin 15 progresses.</p>

<h2>Future plans</h2>

<p>Sketch Mode will eventually allow editing the existing design. It might also
provide a more realistic preview capability which shows what the components
look like in the actual design.</p>

<p>Figma is a popular design tool among designers (rather than developers). There
is a plugin for Figma called &ldquo;Designs to Layouts&rdquo; which allows exprorting
designs from Figma. Those exported designs are already editable in Unide.
The features of the plugin will eventually be integrated into Unide,
allowing one to connect to Figma and import designs from there directly.</p>

<p>Exporting full projects for frameworks like Angular, Vue, Preact, Svelte and
others is a more distant, but realistic goal. Also users should be able to
add further Web Components in addition to the built-in Vaadin Components.</p>

<p>Last not but least, Unide will receive much needed refactorings, tests and
many other things that will increase its robustness.</p>
